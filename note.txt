NOTE

fastmine: miner, c++, not touch
spedn: smart contract
- slp-miner-reward-v0.spedn = Produces a constant mining reward, constant hashing rate (difficulty = 2)
- slp-miner-reward-v1.spedn = Produces a variable mining reward with 8 halving events, constant hashing rate (difficulty = 2), and has a CLTV set to 1 block so that SLP mining matches blocks
- slp-miner-reward-v2.spedn = Same as v1 plus a Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm driven by baton value amount, higher BCH value on the baton results in higher mining difficulty
- slp-miner-reward-v3.spedn = (Not completed) Same as v2 plus an additional dev fund p2sh output

Note v1: 
// preimage deserializaion: split to get data
// check sig to enforce valid preimage and scriptCode: check sig
// verify new state is updated to the proper block height: check the next p2sh tokenHeight is correct

// calculate proper mintAmount based on current block height: check height for division

// flip the byte order for SLP output amount

// verify the miner's solution is acceptable using the prev difficulty: check miner diff is correct

// prepend the new state to rawscr: prepare data

Prepare 3 output

convert.ts
Purpose: This script convert mnemonic phrase into private key, public key and wif

generatev1:
unlock v0 and generate v1 to mine

init:
generate v0 for the first block

mine-first-block:
mine the first block

-----------------------
0. Go to cashtab and create token. Then go to .env TOKEN_INIT_REWARD_V1, TOKEN_START_BLOCK_V1, TOKEN_ID_V1

1. go init.ts and edit and get p2sh address

Optional: go to convert file to get private key and public key of wallet that own the token

2. run send-baton.ts
edit walletSk, decodeCashAddress

3. run mine-first-block

4. generate-v1

-----
goal: every 144 blocks, diff / 0.99981

block: check diff is equal, figure out how fastmine work to adjust diff based on algo
